## faceScanner
# A face scanner with OpenCV

This is a face scannign program based off of the frontal face default cascade from the haarcascade dataset. The program then loads in an image (in this case of me)
and will draw a rectangle over any faces it identifies.

This is not a complete project though. I plan to create my own cascade and utilize it to create a facial recognition system.
